			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
			<p>
				In this section, we'll sketch some prototype visualizations that attempt to answer the question:
				<b>how has the relative proportion of ages changed since 1900?</b>
			</p>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/sketch1.jpeg" alt="Hand-drawn sketch of a faceted histogram of population by age in 1900 vs 2000." />
				<figcaption>
					Sketch of faceted (small multiples) histogram of number of people per age bucket, faceted by year.
					Top panel shows the data for 1900 and bottom panel shows the year 2000. Horizontal and vertical axes
					use the same scales on both facets.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				In case my handwriting is illegible, the title is "How has the relative proportion of ages changed since 1900?",
				the vertical axis reads "# of people", and the horizontal axis reads "Age bucket".
			</p>
			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					When trying to get a sense of the overall distribution of binned data like this, I typically start with a histogram,
					so I was thinking that being able to see the histograms for both years in the same view would give a good overview
					of the two distributions and allow the viewer to compare.
				</li>
				<li>
					Shared axis for age bins allow for (somewhat) easy visual comparison between the two years.
				</li>
				<li>
					I don't like that the visual separation of data (i.e. white space between bottom of 1900 facet and top of 2000 bars)
					means you have to look back and forth between the two histograms to draw any conclusions.
				</li>
				<li>
					Presenting all the data in a relatively raw form allows the viewer to perform any comparison they're interested in,
					given enough time, but there isn't really an immediate takeaway that jumps out at you here.
				</li>
				<li>
					Using same scale for vertical axes communicates the growth in total population, but also makes it more difficult to
					compare relative proportions.
				</li>
				<li>
					Overall it seems like small multiples is nice for showing both data sets individually for an initial exploration,
					but it's hard to make quick comparisons.
				</li>
				<li>
					For my next sketch, I'd like to see if I can come up with something where both datasets are in the same facet and
					also allows comparing relative proportions more easily.
				</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/sketch2.jpeg" alt="Hand-drawn sketch of cumulative distribution of ages in 1900 vs 2000." />
				<figcaption>
					Step plot showing the cumulative distribution of age. The years 1900 and 2000 are shown as a plain line and a hatched
					line respectively, although in a real version of this plot, the hatched line would just be a different color.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Again, in case my handwriting is illegible, the title is "How have the distributions of ages changed since 1900?",
				the vertical axis reads "Cumulative percentage of population" with "w/ age less than X" crossed out, the
				horizontal axis reads "Age bucket", the legend reads "Year" with an arrow pointing to "Hatches are a stand-in for different
				color".
			</p>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Looking at cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) can be a quick way to answer questions like "what percentage of
					the population is above/below age X?" (e.g what percentage is over 75 years old, or under 20 years old?).
				</li>
				<li>
					By putting both CDFs on the same plot, we can be visually drawn to points where the distributions begin to signficantly
					differ, as these are often points where the lines cross. For example, if the percentage of children is lower in 1900,
					we'll see this as the 1900 line starting below the 2000 line, and then eventually crossing as we reach adult ages.
				</li>
				<li>
					A downside of this type of plot is that CDFs are typically not immediately intuitive, and typically require viewers to
					understand (or remind themselves of) a CDF before they can actually start parsing out interesting comparisons of the
					distributions.
				</li>
				<li>
					Another downside is that there's not an obvious way to incorporate the sex information into this plot without making
					separate lines for each sex/year combination, which would result in four CDFs and a very crowded visualization.
				</li>
				<li>
					While one can more quickly compare the two distributions and read off interesting summary statistics, there still isn't
					really an immediately digestible takeaway here.
				</li>
				<li>
					For my next sketch, I'd like to combine the intuitive nature of the histogram with the ability to read off interesting
					quantiles from the CDF. It would also be nice to incorporte the reported sex information.
				</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/sketch3.jpeg" alt="Hand-drawn sketch of stacked bar plots of number of people of a given age in 1900 vs 2000, emanating from common vertical axis" />
				<figcaption>
					Stacked bar plot of number of people in a given age bucket, with male and female split out (note that male vs female are
					shown as plain vs dotted bars here, but would be shown with colors in the final version). Bars emanate from a common vertical
					axis, with population counts for 1900 shown on the left (higher numbers go to left) and 2000 shown on the right (higher numbers
					go to the right). I've also annotated quantiles of the age distributions with dashed lines and arrows pointing to the
					average life expectancy in both years.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				One final time, in case my handwriting is illegible, the title is "How has the distributions of ages changed since 1900?",
				the vertical axis reads "Age bucket" and the horizontal axis reads "# of people". The legend shows an empty box for "Male"
				and a dotted box for "Female". Horizontal dashed lines indicate quartiles and read "25%", "50%", and "75%". At the top
				of the plot canvas reads "Avg life expectancy" with arrows pointing to made-up values.
			</p>
			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Showing bar plots like the first sketch is a more intuitive mark that a viewer can immediately parse as a longer bar
					meaning a bigger number.
				</li>
				<li>
					Having bar plots emanate from a common base reduces the distance that the eye has to travel to compare the two
					distributions.
				</li>
				<li>
					Using a vertical common axis instead of a horizontal common axis helps prevent viewers from wondering if something
					is going on with negative numbers.
				</li>
				<li>
					Using stacked bar charts makes it relatively easy to look at the sex proportion within an age bucket. Since it seems like
					most buckets are a 50/50 split between male and female, the main interesting takeaway is the enrichment for women at
					older ages, which is a coarse enough takeaway to be communicated in a stacked bar chart.
				</li>
				<li>
					Adding in dashed lines for quantiles does make the chart a bit more busy, but gives some reference points for summary
					statistics of the distributions. Comparing the vertical position of lines also gives a quick comparison.
					<ul>
						<li>
							In a final version, it would be good to figure out a way to visually distinguish the 3 quartile lines (e.g.
							different color or stroke for 25%, 50%, 75%) to allow quick comparison of the same quartiles across the
							two distributions.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Average life expectancy is a quantity that most people have an intuitive grasp of, so showing it here can be a quick
					way to emphasize many more older people in 2000 compared to 1900 and provides a quickly digestible takeaway message.
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
    	I think my sketches show a bit of an evolution of trying to pack more and more information into each plot, likely at the expense
		of a viewer being able to immediately grasp what's being shown. The first sketch is a bit too basic in the sense that it doesn't
		really show much beyond the raw data and a rough "feel" for the data. It's more of the type of exploratory plot one might generate
		upon first receiving a dataset. The second sketch of the CDFs provides a reflective visualization that can allow one to calculate
		off interesting quantities, but I think it's a bit overly technical so may be a bit confusing at first glance. The third sketch
		landed on a nice way to both portray the raw data in a way that facilitates visual comparison, while also preserving some interesting
		summary statistics. My only worry with the third sketch is that it's a bit crowded with all the annotations. For my final version,
		I'll likely carry forward the design from sketch 3, but try to think of ways to reduce the amount of visual clutter and also
		more clearly emphasize a takeaway message of an older US population in 2000 compared to 1900.

				<figcaption>
				Comparison of age demographics in the United States in the years 1900 and 2000. Age distributions are shown as horizontal bar charts
				with population of females and males split out as separate stacked bars. Bars emanate from a common vertical axis: right facet shows
				the year 1900 and left facet shows the year 2000. Additional horizontal lines and annotations show median age and life expectancy in
				both years.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>
			<p>
				Before looking at the dataset in depth, my initial goal was to provide a high-level sense of how age demographics have shifted in the
				100 years between 1900 and 2000. After looking at the dataset some more (i.e. after the sketching), I thought that an interesting takeaway
				is how much older the population is overall. However, I felt like the dataset is fairly rich for inspection and reflection, so I
				also wanted to provide a full enough view of the data that a viewer could inspect and reflect on their own to ask any questions they might
				have.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the sketching exercise, I felt that the third sketch provided the best balance of having a quickly parseable takeaway while also
				providing the rich representation that could allow a viewer to ask their own follow-up questions. Because I still felt that the sketch was
				a bit visually crowded, I shifted away from the quartile lines and instead decided to just show median age and life expectancy as two
				immediate takeaways and concrete points of comparison between the two age distributions. I also felt that it would be nice to have a
				concrete point of reference for just how different the US looked in 1900 vs 2000, hence the small photos of Times Square (a well-known
				landmark) at both timepoints.
			</p>
			<p>
				An enumeration of other design decisions and their rationale are as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>
						I selected a bar chart for the core visualization, as length from a common baseline is one of the most effective encodings for
						comparing quantities.
					</li>
					<li>
						I further made the plot into a stacked bar chart because this allows for quick evaluation of the approximate proportions of
						female vs male in a given age bucket, and the main takeaway of enrichment for women at older ages is strong enough to come
						through in this coarse representation of proportions.
					</li>
					<li>
						As discussed above, having bars emanate from a common axis more quickly facilitates comparison between the two distributions
						without having to move your eyes back and forth across a lot of whitespace each time.
					</li>
					<li>
						I selected a common horizontal scale both for practical reasons (it would be confusing to have two different scales on the
						same axis) and also to indirectly show population growth between the two timepoints, although I did not choose to explicitly
						show the total population count, as the number of annotations was already getting a bit crowded.
					</li>
					<li>
						I added slight spacing between bars to visually distinguish the different age buckets and make it easier to count off the intermediate
						buckets without cluttering the vertical axis with a label for each bin.
					</li>
					<li>
						I added vertical grid lines since the plot is very tall, so it's easy to lose track of the scale as you look up. In contrast, I
						removed horizontal grid lines to reduce visual clutter, as the plot is fairly narrow and the discrete nature of bins makes it
						a bit easier to count off what age bucket you're looking at.
					</li>
					<li>
						I reduced the alpha on the bars to make them fade a bit so as to emphasize the annotations for a quick takeaway message.
					</li>
					<li>
						While the standard blue/pink for male/female can be more immediately understandable by some, I felt the extra few seconds
						of checking a legend is worth it for the gain of not perpetuating the "shrink it and pink it" stereotype of assigning pink
						to women.
					</li>
					<li>
						I moved the vertical axis labels to the right side both to allow the viewer to first focus on the annotations and also to
						make the axis labels closer to actual data due to the large amount of whitespace on the left side of the visualization.
					</li>
				</ul>
				Overall I think my design decisions served my goal of giving an immediate takeaway that the US population in 2000 is generally older than
				the US population in 1900, while also allowing an interested viewer to ask their own questions and parse other interesting aspects of the
				data (e.g. enrichment of women at older ages, larger overall population in 2000, and the growing proportion of middle-aged people in 2000).
				I do think that my choice of a stacked bar chart focusing on ages makes it hard to read off finer-grained information about female-male
				proportions, both within and across the two timepoints.
			</p>
      		<h3>Reflection</h3>
			<p>
				The sketching process was definitely helpful in terms of rapidly iterating on different ideas for visualization without having to go through
				the nitty-gritty of getting your favorite visualization tool to actually make the plot you're imagining in your head (e.g. it likely would've
				taken awhile to get the CDF plot to come out correctly). The sketching phase helped me try out ways of progressively integrating more information
				into the visualization while also realizing that a faceted histogram was a bit too "raw", a CDF was fairly unapproachable, and that the first
				iteration of the horizontal stacked bar chart was too visually crowded. I think in the future, I'd like to continue with the sketching process,
				and try to explore a bit more "wild" types of visualizations during it, as my sketches here seemed like a bit of a linear path of increasing
				complexity, rather than a breadth-first exploration of many distinct types of ideas (although this may have also been driven by having the same
				underlying question for all the sketches).
